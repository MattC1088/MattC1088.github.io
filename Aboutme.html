        <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>My name is Matthew Carvalho and I attend the<a href="https://www.uri.edu/"> University of Rhode Island</a>. I am entering my<br>
               second year at URI as a sophomore majoring in Mechancial Engineering. Recently however, I <br>
               could not decided if I wanted to switch majors to Computer Engineering as I like both fields so<br>
               I have decided to pick up a minor in Computer Science. I love physics and I love computers so I am <br>
                very excited for the classes to come in both my major and my minor. </p>
            <p>Outside of school I love to play and watch sports. I love playing soccer and basketball and<br>
               I play them whever I am not doing school work. My favorite basketball team to watch are the<br>
       <strong>Boston Celtics</strong>. My favorite soccer team to watch from Spain is <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> and my favorite<br>
                soccer team to watch from England is <strong>Manchester City</strong>. Other than sports, I love spending time with<br>
                my frineds and family and going to the beach with them. I love playing with my dog Scooter.
